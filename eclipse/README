== Instruction for adding Eclipse projects into your Eclipse ==

First set the Path Variables in 
  Window > Preferences > General > Workspace Linked Resources
to following:

Name: "HOME", Value: "/home/<user>"
Name: "KIZAI", Value: "/home/<user>/kizai"
Name: "NEXT", Value: "/home/<user>/next"

If the git repositories are under a different path, then edit the paths as
required.

---

Now go find the file "/home/<user>/kizai/eclipse/Template.userlibraries" and
replace occurrences of $HOME with your home direcotory '/home/<user>'.

This can be done easiest with the UNIX console command
  "sed 's_$HOME_/home/<user>_g' <Template.userlibraries >eclipse.userlibraries"
in the folder with the file.

Once this is done go to
  Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > User Libraries
and press 'Import...', 'Browse...', find the new eclipse.userlibraries file.

---

Once path variables and the user libraries are set go to
  File > Import... > General > Existing Projects into Workspace

Mark 'Select root directory:', click 'Browse' and choose path 
  "/home/<user>/kizai/eclipse".
Click 'Select All' and 'Finish'.

Repeat the same for "/home/<user>/next/eclipse".

---

You are now ready to get programming.
